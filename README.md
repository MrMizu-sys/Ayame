# Errors
#### If you get (.....) is not a Function or Not a Constructor Make sure to check these!
```js
function ExampleCommand(/*The things youve define MAKE SURE IT HAS THE RIGHT PLACE OR ELSE IT WILL THROW THE CONFUSING ERRORS.*/) {

}
module.exports = ExampleCommand; //<- It gotta be the same as function or else it will throw that 'Is not a function or constructor Errors!'.
```
